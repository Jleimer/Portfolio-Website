                <p>
                    The beginning of my design process is rooted from my imagination.  I find myself highly influenced by science fiction, such as robotics and stories of mad scientists.
                    I integrate many non-traditional materials and found objects, challenging myself to include these materials without making them permanent.  Many of my pieces I consider
                    to be sculptural, but they are very interactive and influence people to want to pick up the piece and interact with it.  I begin my pieces with an idea and a starting 
                    point, and I let my imagination take over the design process, letting the piece to develop as my imagination begins to build as I work.  This allows me to work out and 
                    develop each aspect of a piece with attention and detail as I see it develop.  When a piece is finished it brings a smile to my face seeing something that was an imagined 
                    story in my head to becoming something I can touch and use.
