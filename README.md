# Portfolio-Website
This website is a portfolio to for my work as an artist as well as a web designer.  When you click on the items in the header you are taken 
to each section and when you click on resume it opens up a pdf link to my resume.  I was able to establish the media queries for
screen adjustments. under the artwork section I included a couple pictures of some of my art. I fell short on time to make the 
experience better as far as being able to click on items and any animation.Im excited to have started this and am looking forward to 
completing it and making it better.
